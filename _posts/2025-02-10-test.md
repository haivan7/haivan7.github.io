## 2. Challenge Description

### Challenge Name: [Challenge Name]
### Category: [Web/Cryptography/Forensics/...]
### Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
### Description:
[A brief description of the challenge. This usually includes the issue you need to solve, any hints provided (if any), and the objective of the challenge.]

## 3. Tools Used

During the process of solving this challenge, I used the following tools and techniques:
- **Nmap**: To scan open ports and services.
- **Burp Suite**: To check for vulnerabilities in the web application.
- **Netcat**: To connect to TCP/UDP services.
- **Python**: To create scripts automating tasks.
- **Hydra**: To perform brute-force attacks on passwords.

## 4. Analysis and Solution

### Step 1: Scanning Open Ports

I started by running Nmap to scan for open ports on the target IP address. The result showed several open ports such as HTTP (80), SSH (22), and another unidentified port.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
Result:

pgsql

PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 7.6p1
80/tcp  open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.7
